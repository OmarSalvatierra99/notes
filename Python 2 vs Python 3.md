A programming language is constantly evolving to become better and better because nobody gets it right the first time.

Why are there so many programming languages?
- You can be a really successful developer programmer with just one language, just finding that specialty  
- Every programming language is a different tool that you can use for a special situation 
- You don't have to learn more than two or three programming languages in your entire career 
- Python is usually slower than languages like C, C++, and Java 
	- Python is useful for productive development because it's easy and very similar to the English language. If you want to write more complex programs, **you may need to use other languages.** 
- In conclusion **the reason there are so many programming languages is that every language excels at some things and doesn't do so well at others**
