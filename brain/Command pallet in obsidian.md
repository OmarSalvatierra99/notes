Run Python Script from command pallet in Obsidian MD 

```promt
I use the Shell Commands Obsidian plugin. The logic of my scripts must always run consistently. Improve and optimize the script. Always check the _scripts_ folder, which contains `.md` files and Python scripts. Inside _scripts_, create a single `logs` folder for all log files to track any errors when the app fails. Apply the logic directly without interacting with the user.
