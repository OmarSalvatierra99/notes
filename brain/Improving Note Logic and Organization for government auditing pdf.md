**Goal:** Create a system that work naturally with my projects and consistently improves note logic.

**Input:** PDFs in Spanish related to government auditing. 

Here's a concise, shareable prompt for Claude to **achieve** my goal: 

```prompt
Create a natural, automated system for taking notes from government auditing PDFs. The PDFs are only in Spanish and are stored in the `pdf` folder. The system should:

- Extract text and tables automatically from the PDFs using Python.
    
- Organize and save all notes in the `auditoria-gubernamental` folder, with `#auditoria` as the first line of each note.
    
- Summarize key findings, risks, discrepancies, and recommendations using AI.
    
- Follow a logical structure: Context → Evidence → Issue/Risk → Impact → Recommendation.
    
- Track errors or failures in a `logs` folder inside the project.
    
- Include ideas for Python scripts and AI integration to fully automate note creation and improve the government auditing process.
```
