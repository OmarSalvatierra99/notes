## Introduction 
"A genius is the man who can do the average thin when everyone else around him is losing his mind." - Napoleon

"The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes" -Sherlock Holmes

- Success with money depends less on intelligence and more on behavior -which even smart people struggle to master 
- Money doesn't care who you are - it cares how you act. Ronald Read proved that quiet discipline and patience can build a fortune from almost nothing, while Richard Fuscone showed that ego and excess can destroy everything, no matter how brilliant or educated you are. 
- True wealth isn't about income, status, or luxury - it's about freedom, peace and control. The bravest thing you can do with money is refuse to let it control you. Save when others spend, think long-term when others chase quick wins, and never trade stability for appearance. 
- Money rewards humility, patience and consistency - and punishes greed, pride and hate
