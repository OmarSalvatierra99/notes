We are going to talk about violence. Do you think it is human nature, or is it something we learn through reason?

- Violence has both biological and learned components. Some aggression comes from our instincts as animals -it helped early humans survive. However, how and when we use violence is mostly learned through culture, society, and personal experiences.

## Violence as part of human nature

Judge Holden's monologue:

"It makes no difference what men think of war," said the judge. "War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be. That way and not some other way.

War is god."

"Men of god and men of war have strange affinities," said Tobin.

"You’re a fool," said the judge. "If war is not holy man is nothing but antic clay. Even the cretin acted in the name of war. Wars are fought for men’s souls, and the spirit of war is the spirit of bloodlust. War is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of one’s will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god."

"Men are born for games. Nothing else. Every child knows that play is nobler than work. He knows too that the worth or merit of a game is not inherent in the game itself but rather in the value of that which is put at hazard. Games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all. Games of sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient stake because they inhere in the worth of the principals and define them.

But trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all. Supposing the will of man to be larger than that of the game.

But it is not so. In the end it is the game that swallows up the player that is left to ponder the meaning of the game.

War is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of one’s will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god."
