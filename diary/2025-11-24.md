Because it combines the things I enjoy the most: backend development, data engineering, and cloud technologies. I like solving real problems, improving performance, and working on systems that need to be reliable and scalable 

I stay calm, prioritize task, and break the work into smaller steps. I focus on the most critical features and communicate clearly about progress and risk, so we can deliver on time without sacrificing quality

I mainly use FastAPI for building APIs because it's fast, modern, and has great automatic documentation. For data processing I use Pandas and NumPy, for databases SQLAlchemy, for testing PyTest, and for AWS automation I use boto3.
