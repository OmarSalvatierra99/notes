I am building a productivity dashboard inside my Obsidian vault using the Dataview plugin. I want to connect my notes in the folders and track their progress using the tags `#working` and `#completed`. I want to do it super minimalist just a list like and inbox just #working and a unarchive list from #completed just for references
